# Purpose:                      Create a python script:
# * Alter your search code to recursively scan each file and folder in the user input directory path and print it to the screen.

# * For each file scanned within the scope of your search directory:

#   * Generate the fileâ€™s MD5 hash using Hashlib.

#   * Assign the MD5 hash to a variable.

#   * Print the variable to the screen along with a timestamp, file name, file size, and complete (not symbolic) file path.


# Import libraries
import os
from time import sleep
import platform

# Declare variables
my_os = platform.system()

print(my_os)

                hits.append(os.path.join(dirpath, file))
