# Ops Challenge: File Encryption Script Part 3 of 3

## Overview

Encryption is a powerful tool that can be used defensively or offensively.

For this challenge, finish development of your Python script. You have been tasked with training users by letting them experience a ransomware attack. Update your script, adding an option that gives us the ability to add a ransomware note visible to the Windows user, after the data is encrypted.

## Requirements

Add a feature capability to your Python encryption tool to:

* Alter the desktop wallpaper on a Windows PC with a ransomware message

* Create a popup window on a Windows PC with a ransomware message

*Make this feature optional. In the user menu prompt, add this as a ransomware simulation option.*
