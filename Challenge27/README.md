# Ops Challenge: Event Logging Tool Part 2 of 3

## Overview

Logging system events for response and/or analysis is a major part of security operations. Logs create accountability and also provide signals to build automation systems around. With proper logging and monitoring, a SOC team can respond quickly and appropriately as events unfold.

Today you will add log rotation capabilities to your Python script.

## Requirements

On the Python tool you added logging capabilities to:

* Add a log rotation feature based on size

## Stretch Goals (Optional Objectives)

Copy the Python tool and remove the log rotation by size feature. Instead:

* Add a log rotation feature based on time

Submit both versions of your script.
