## Part 3: Automating the Configuration

In some scenarios, you may need to harden an existing machine. Automating the process will save you a great deal of time in the long run.

Reverse your configuration changes to:

* 1.1.5 (L1)

* 18.4.3 (L1)

Write a PowerShell script that automates the configuration of the required settings:

* 1.1.5 (L1)

* 18.4.3 (L1)

*Test and validate it works as desired.*

*Copy it to your public GitHub repo as a new entry. Link to it in your submission.*
