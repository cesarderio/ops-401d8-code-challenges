# Script Name:                  Network Security Tool with Scapy Part 2 of 3
# Author:                       Raphael Chookagian
# Date of latest revision:      07/25/2023
# Purpose:                      Create a python script:
# * Ping an IP address determined by the user.
# * If the host exists, scan its ports and determine if any are open.
# ## Tasks
# Hereâ€™s a general outline of how to achieve the desired outcome.
# * In Python, combine the two modes (port and ping) of your network scanner script.
# * Eliminate the choice of mode selection.
# * Continue to prompt the user for an IP address to target.
# * Move port scan to its own function.
# * Call the port scan function if the host is responsive to ICMP echo requests.
# * Print the output to the screen.
# ## Stretch Goals (Optional Objectives)
# * Instead of targeting a single IP address, allow the user to specify a range of IPs and have the tool scan each one in succession.
