# Ops Challenge: Event Logging Tool Part 1 of 3

## Overview

Logging system events for response and/or analysis is a major part of security operations. Logs create accountability and also provide signals to build automation systems around. With proper logging and monitoring, a SOC team can respond quickly and appropriately as events unfold.

Today you will begin incorporating logging capabilities into one of your existing Python tools.

## Resources

[What Are stdin, stdout, and stderr on Linux?](https://www.howtogeek.com/435903/what-are-stdin-stdout-and-stderr-on-linux/)

[Logging Module in Python](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/logging-module-in-python/)

## Requirements

First, visit [Python Logging Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#logging-basic-tutorial) and practice the Basic Logging Tutorial.

Next, review terminology at [What Are stdin, stdout, and stderr on Linux?](https://www.howtogeek.com/435903/what-are-stdin-stdout-and-stderr-on-linux/) before visiting [Logging Module in Python](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/logging-module-in-python/) for some examples to get you started.

By now, you will have created several Python scripts in your public repo. Select one of your Python tools created during this class so far that does not have a logging feature. On that tool:

* Add logging capabilities to your Python tool using the logging library.

* Experiment with log types. Build in some error handling, then induce some errors. Send log data to a file in the local directory.

* Confirm your logging feature is working as expected.
